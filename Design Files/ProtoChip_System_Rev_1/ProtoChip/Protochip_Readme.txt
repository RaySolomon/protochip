The Protochip consist of a channel running through two fused PMMA (Acryllic) peices. Also running through
the pieces of acrylic are two embedded platinum electrodes along with one embedded Silver/SilverChloride electrode.
The electrodes contact the channel running tangent to the bottom of the channel and perpendicular from the long sides
of the peices. The top piece of acrylic has two wells from which fluid can be fed or drained. Rubber gaskets are
placed surrounding the wells to alow fluid tight contact with a syringe, eliminating the need to use tubing. The top
piece is shorter that the bottom piece in width which leaves room to use copper tape to secure the electrodes to the
bottom piece of acrylic. This serves a double function of protecting the fragile electrodes from pulling forces that
may break them and also to provide solid contact to the cheapstat through the ProtoAttachment system.

The protochip consists of 7 parts. The entire assembly can be seem in Protochip_Assemble.stl.
