The hardware of the Protochip System consist of three different subsystems: 
The Cheapstat, The ProtoAttachment, and the Protochip. The Protochip is the interface with the fluid to be analyzed.
The ProtoAttachment provides a sturdy and convinient interface between the exisitng Cheapstat system and the Protochip.
The Cheapstat is an electronic system which performs voltametric analysis. Together these systems interact to make a
convinient chemical detection system in fluids.
