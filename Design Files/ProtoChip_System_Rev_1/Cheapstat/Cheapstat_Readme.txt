The Cheapstat system is composed of a PCB board along with a casing consisting of 4 parts. The system outputs
voltametric data through USB and interfaces with the user through a LCD screen and toggle button which can 
be seen in the STL file. The cheapstat interfaces with the Protochip through leads running to the ProtoAttachment system.
The PCB board file consists of the general dimensions of the board along with large features, but smaller electrical
features. These can be found at https://github.com/nebulabio/CheapStat/tree/master/schematic.
