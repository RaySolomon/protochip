The hardware of the Protochip System consist of three different subsystems: 

1. The Cheapstat - an electronic system which performs voltametric analysis.
1. The ProtoAttachment - provides a sturdy and convinient interface between the exisitng Cheapstat system and the Protochip.
1. The Protochip - the interface with the fluid to be analyzed.

Together these systems interact to make a convinient chemical detection system in fluids.
