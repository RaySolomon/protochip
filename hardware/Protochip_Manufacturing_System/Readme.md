A system which creates consistent protochips as defined by protochip design files
(https://github.com/nebulabio/protochip/tree/master/Design%20Files/ProtoChip_System_Rev_1/ProtoChip).
The manufacturing system consists of two pieces the hot press and the moulds. 
It is operated with a protocol which, with the right combinations of temperature, pressure, and time produces, 
protochips with the dimensions and characteristics of the protochip design files. 

**Each Design File has a drawing and 3d cad file**

The first file is the mold for the microchannel(Microchannel_Mold.stl) which is placed in the Hot Emboss Press.
