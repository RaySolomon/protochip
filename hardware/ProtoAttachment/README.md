The ProtoAttachment system refers to a plastic part (in our case 3D-Printed) designed
to snuggly fit the Protochip in order to allow good contact between leads coming
from the cheapstat and the electrodes coming from the Protochip. This is achieved through
copper tape placed on the ends of the leads from the cheapstat which safely holds them
to the attachment while also providing a good contact surface to mate with the Protochip.
The Protochip is locked into place using a metal bar place in the attchment behind the chip.
