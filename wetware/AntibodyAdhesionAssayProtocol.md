#Antibody Adhesion Assay Protocol


The purpose of this assay is to determine the level of adhesion of antibody on untreated 96-well plates, treated 96 well plates, and PMMA. 


###Materials Needed
1. Untreated 96 well plates
2. Treated 96 well plates
3. Laser Cut PMMA
4. Monoclonal anti-cortisol Solution (10 mg/L)
5. Fluorescent Secondary Antibody (10 mg/L)
6. NaOH (1 mol/L)
7. PEI (.2%)
8. Glutaraldehyde (1%w/v)
9. BSA (5% in 10Mm PBS)
10. Aluminum Foil
11. Fluorescent Microscope


###Methods for Polystyrene and PMMA
1. Pipette 350 microliters of NaOH(1 mol/L) in all wells besides blank.
2. Place in oven of 55 C for 30 Minutes.
3. After perform 3 Washes with distilled water
4. Place 350 microliters PEI solution (.2%) in all wells except Blank and X[PEI+Glut]
5. Place 350 microliters of distilled water to Blank and X[PEI+Glut]
6. Let sit for 1 hour at room temperature
7. Wash wells with distilled water(3x)
8. Pipette 350 microliters of Glutaraldehyde solution (1%w/v) in to all wells except Blank and X[PEI+Glut]
9. Let sit for 30 minutes at room temperature.
10. Wash wells with distilled water(3x)
11. Pipette 350 microliters of mouse monoclonal antibody solution(10 mg/L) in wells X[Secondary], ALL, and X[PEI+Glut]. 
12. Incubate at 4C overnight
13. Wash wells with PBS.
14. Pipette 350 microliters of BSA solution (5% in 10mM PBS) into wells all wells except Blank
15. Let sit for 3 hours
16. Pipette 350 microliters Secondary Antibody Solution to all except X[Secondary] and Blank
17. Wrap in foil and Incubate at 37 C for 20 minutes.

2. Incubate at 4C overnight.
3. Wash wells with PBS.
4. Pipette 350 microliters of BSA solution (5% in 10mM PBS) into wells all wells except Blank
5. Let sit for 3 hours
6. Pipette 350 microliters Secondary Antibody Solution to all except X[Secondary] and Blank
