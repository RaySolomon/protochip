## Characterization of Stock Hydrocortisone
The purpose of this test is to verify the concentration of stock hydrocortisone(Cortisol) purchased from RnD Systems.

###Materials Needed
1. RnD Cortisol Parameter Assay (PKGE008)
2. Generic Face Mask
3. RnD Hydrocortisone (4093)
4. Plate Reader

###Methods

1. Bring all reagents to room temperature before use.
2. Cortisol is found in saliva. It is recommended that a face mask and gloves be used to protect kit reagents from contamination.
1. Remove excess microplate strips from the plate frame, return them to the foil pouch containing the desiccant pack, and reseal.
2. Add 150 μL of Calibrator Diluent RD5-43 into the non-specific binding (**NSB**) wells.
3. Add 100 μL of Calibrator Diluent RD5-43 to the zero standard (**B0**) wells.
4. Cortisol Standard
	1. Reconstitute the Cortisol Standard with deionized or distilled water. This reconstitution produces a stock solution of 100 ng/mL. Mix the standard to ensure complete reconstitution and allow the standard to sit for a minimum of 15 minutes with gentle agitation prior to making dilutions.
	3. Use the 100 ng/mL standard stock to produce a dilution series.
	4. Mix each tube thoroughly and change pipette tips between eachtransfer. The 10 ng/mL standard serves as the high standard and Calibrator Diluent RD5-43 serves as the zero standard (B0)(0 ng/mL).
	5. Use diluted standards within 60 minutes of preparation
7. Sample Prep
	1. Reconstitute hydrocortison in 3mL of DI water
	2. Perform Dilutions to create concentrations in Test Setup
4. Add 100 μL of Standard or sample to the appropriate wells(**See Test Setup**)
5. Add 50 μL of Cortisol Conjugate to all wells. Wells will now be red in color.
6. Add 50 μL of the Primary Antibody Solution to each well (**excluding the NSB wells**).
7. Cover with the adhesive strip provided. All wells will now be violet in color except the NSB wells, which will be red in color.
8. Incubate for 2 hours at room temperature on a horizontal orbital microplate shaker (**0.12" orbit**) set at 500 ± 50 rpm.
9. Substrate Solution : Color Reagents A and B should be mixed together in equal volumes within 15 minutes of use. Protect from light. 200 μL of the resultant mixture is required per well.
9. Wash Buffer : If crystals have formed in the concentrate, warm to room temperature and mix gently until the crystals have completely dissolved. Add 20 mL of Wash Buffer Concentrate to deionized or distilled water to prepare 500 mL of Wash Buffer.
9. Aspirate each well and wash, repeating the process three times for a total of four washes. Wash by filling each well with Wash Buffer (**400 μL**) using a squirt bottle, manifold dispenser, or autowasher. Complete removal of liquid at each step is essential for good performance. After the last wash, remove any remaining Wash Buffer by aspirating or decanting. Invert the plate and blot it against clean paper towels.
11. Add 200 μL of Substrate Solution to each well. Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature on the benchtop. Protect from light.
12. Add 50 μL of Stop Solution to each well. The color in the wells should change from blue to yellow. If the color in the well is green or the color change does not appear uniform, gently tap the plate to ensure thorough mixing.
13. Determine the optical density of each well within 30 minutes, using a microplate reader set to 450 nm. If wavelength correction is available, set to 540 nm or 570 nm. If wavelength correction is not available, subtract readings at 540 nm or 570 nm from the readings at 450 nm. This subtraction will correct for optical imperfections in the plate. Readings made directly at 450 nm without correction may be higher and less accurate.
